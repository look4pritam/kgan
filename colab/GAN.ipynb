The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.\n","\n","# References\n","* [Generative Adversarial Networks - arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)\n","* [Generative Adversarial Networks - github.com](https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pLY-O5f_aDel","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Clone kgan repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7iX5wfL9_act","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!git clone https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan.git"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HRoA21iaCB2_","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!ls -al"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d9I1_1mEaKaR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Set the root directory."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"awn7Chl-CUaC","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import os\n","\n","root_dir = '/content/kgan'\n","os.chdir(root_dir)\n","\n","!ls -al"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mr1_SYfZbWOX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Train GAN model using MNIST dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_PWnuupCXBe8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Update local repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xEpqXv4eaQa9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!git pull origin"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L_MJZUkRXGf-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Train the model."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fmEAKGApbXgT","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!export PYTHONPATH=/content/kgan:$PYTHONPATH; \\\n","                   python kgan/train_model.py \\\n","                   --model gan \\\n","                   --dataset mnist \\\n","                   --model_shape 28 28 1 \\\n","                   --latent_dimension 100 \\\n","                   --learning_rate 0.0002 \\\n","                   --batch_size 64 \\\n","                   --maximum_epochs 100 \\\n","                   --start_epoch 0 \\\n","                   --discriminator_number 1 \\\n","                   --generator_number 1 \\\n","                   --save_frequency 1 \\\n","                   --loss_scan_frequency 100"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q4HKVHChYyA-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Visualize training graphs."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AYJhN6E9YzaR","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["%reload_ext tensorboard\n","%tensorboard --logdir 'logs'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
