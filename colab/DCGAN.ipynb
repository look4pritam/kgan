Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.\n","\n","#References\n","* [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks - arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)\n","* [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network - tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)\n","* [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network - github.com](https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pLY-O5f_aDel","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Clone kgan git repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7iX5wfL9_act","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":136},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595580650525,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10198,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Shete","photoUrl":"","userId":"05325868059698600698"}},"outputId":"6c61feef-6847-4ea3-dc18-e82415c6b217"},"source":["!git clone https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan.git"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Cloning into 'kgan'...\n","remote: Enumerating objects: 383, done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Counting objects: 100% (383/383), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Compressing objects: 100% (258/258), done.\u001b[K\n","remote: Total 383 (delta 259), reused 243 (delta 123), pack-reused 0\u001b[K\n","Receiving objects: 100% (383/383), 50.02 KiB | 303.00 KiB/s, done.\n","Resolving deltas: 100% (259/259), done.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HRoA21iaCB2_","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":119},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595580653985,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13649,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Shete","photoUrl":"","userId":"05325868059698600698"}},"outputId":"99038666-33df-4c62-96ca-0b6a59c1af4f"},"source":["!ls -al"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["total 20\n","drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 .\n","drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:46 ..\n","drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 21 16:12 .config\n","drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 kgan\n","drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 10 16:29 sample_data\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d9I1_1mEaKaR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Set the root directory."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"awn7Chl-CUaC","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":170},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595580657279,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16938,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Shete","photoUrl":"","userId":"05325868059698600698"}},"outputId":"eebb2b91-29ff-46dd-995a-2865a2b41eac"},"source":["import os\n","\n","root_dir = '/content/kgan'\n","os.chdir(root_dir)\n","\n","!ls -al"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["total 32\n","drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 .\n","drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 ..\n","drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 colab\n","drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 .git\n","-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1799 Jul 24 08:50 .gitignore\n","drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Jul 24 08:50 kgan\n","-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1085 Jul 24 08:50 LICENSE\n","-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   58 Jul 24 08:50 README.md\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mr1_SYfZbWOX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Train DCGAN model using MNIST dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_PWnuupCXBe8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Update local repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xEpqXv4eaQa9","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595580661197,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20852,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Shete","photoUrl":"","userId":"05325868059698600698"}},"outputId":"fc011b5b-ab71-4bfb-ab88-3a1e67bb3952"},"source":["!git pull origin"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Already up to date.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L_MJZUkRXGf-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Train the model."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fmEAKGApbXgT","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595582756853,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2116502,"user":{"displayName":"Pritam Shete","photoUrl":"","userId":"05325868059698600698"}},"outputId":"8b5a146b-6975-4da8-fa6f-0e5012eaa23f"},"source":["!export PYTHONPATH=/content/kgan:$PYTHONPATH;
