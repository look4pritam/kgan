Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.\n","\n","# References\n","* [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks - arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)\n","* [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network - tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)\n","* [GAN overriding Model.train_step - keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/generative/dcgan_overriding_train_step/)\n","* [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network - github.com](https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pLY-O5f_aDel","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Clone kgan git repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7iX5wfL9_act","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!git clone https://github.com/look4pritam/kgan.git"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HRoA21iaCB2_","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!ls -al"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d9I1_1mEaKaR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Set the root directory."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"awn7Chl-CUaC","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import os\n","\n","root_dir = '/content/kgan'\n","os.chdir(root_dir)\n","\n","!ls -al"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mr1_SYfZbWOX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Train DCGAN model using MNIST dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_PWnuupCXBe8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Update local repository."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xEpqXv4eaQa9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!git pull origin"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L_MJZUkRXGf-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Train the model."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fmEAKGApbXgT","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!export PYTHONPATH=/content/kgan:$PYTHONPATH; \\\n","                   python kgan/train_model.py \\\n","                   --model dcgan \\\n","                   --dataset mnist \\\n","                   --latent_dimension 128 \\\n","                   --learning_rate 0.0003 \\\n","                   --batch_size 64 \\\n","                   --maximum_epochs 30 \\\n","                   --loss_scan_frequency 1 \\\n","                   --generation_frequency 1 \\\n","                   --save_frequency 1"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vLX-rvcsY6qd","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Visualize training graphs."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9JSrwFxRY7A4","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["%reload_ext tensorboard\n","%tensorboard --logdir 'logs'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
